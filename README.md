# Research Validation Network (RVN)

A decentralized platform built on Stacks blockchain that revolutionizes research validation and reproducibility tracking using smart contracts.

## 🎯 Overview

Research Validation Network (RVN) is a groundbreaking decentralized application that addresses the critical challenge of research reproducibility in scientific communities. By leveraging blockchain technology, RVN creates an immutable, transparent system for validating research findings and incentivizing reproducibility efforts.

## 🌟 Key Features

### Research Fingerprinting
- Secure hash-based research registration
- Immutable timestamping of research submissions
- Unique identification system for research papers
- Tamper-proof research protocol storage

### Validation Scoring System
- Decentralized peer validation mechanism
- Weighted scoring algorithm for research validation
- Multi-validator support with duplicate prevention
- Transparent validation history tracking

### Token Economics
- Native ValidationToken (VT) implementation
- Automatic reward distribution for validators
- Stake-based validation mechanism
- Token-driven incentive alignment

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

The smart contract is built using Clarity and implements:
- Researcher registration and verification
- Research paper submission and tracking
- Validation mechanism with scoring system
- Token management system
- Comprehensive data maps for efficient storage

## 📝 Prerequisites

- Clarinet
- Node.js >= 14
- Stacks Wallet for deployment and testing

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/clarity-research-validation-network.git
cd clarity-research-validation-network
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
clarinet test
```

4. Deploy locally:
```bash
clarinet console
```

## 💻 Usage

### Registering as a Researcher
```clarity
(contract-call? .research-validation-network register-researcher)
```

### Submitting Research
```clarity
(contract-call? .research-validation-network submit-research 0x...)
```

### Validating Research
```clarity
(contract-call? .research-validation-network validate-research u1 u80)
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Comprehensive error handling
- Access control mechanisms
- Input validation
- Safe arithmetic operations
- Duplicate validation prevention
